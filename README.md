# Book Listing App
<h2>Project Overview:</h2>

This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that lists books.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. You will be using the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>App contains a ListView which becomes populated with list items.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>List items display at least author and title information.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>When there are more list items than fit on the screen, the app allows scrolling through the list.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The code adheres to all of the following best practices:</b>
  <ul><li>Text sizes are defined in sp</li>
  <li>Lengths are defined in dp</li>
  <li>Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.</li>
</ul></li>
<br>
<li><b>Information displayed on list items is not crowded.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The content should not be cut off if the device is rotated to landscape mode.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The code runs without errors.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The user can enter a word or phrase to serve as a search query. The app fetches book data related to the query via an HTTP request from the Google Books API, using a class such as HttpUriRequest or HttpURLConnection.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The app checks whether the device is connected to the internet and responds appropriately. The result of the request is validated to account for a bad server response or lack of server response.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The network call occurs off the UI thread using an AsyncTask or similar threading object.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The JSON response is parsed correctly, and relevant information is stored in the app.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The ListView is properly populated with the information parsed from the JSON response.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>When there is no data to display, the app shows a default TextView that informs the user how to populate the list.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The intent of this project is to give you practice writing raw Java code using the necessary classes provided by the Android framework; therefore, the use of external libraries for core functionality will not be permitted to complete this project.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
<br>The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.</b></li>
</ul><br>
